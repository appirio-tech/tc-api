TopCoder API (built on NodeJS)
==============================

As Topcoder(http://www.topcoder.com/tc) and [CloudSpokes](http://www.cloudspokes) integrate, the APIs are going to play a critical role. TopCoder has already started work on a API, which can be found [here](http://dev.topcoder.com). That API is built on a Java stack.

In order to accelerate development we are looking to move some of the API work to use a more cloud-friendly approach built on [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org). This is complicated by the fact that the back end of TC relies on an Informix DB.

Usage
-----

We have provided clear steps to setup in CentOS 6.x, Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows, please check [wiki](https://github.com/cloudspokes/tc-api/wiki)

Other flavors/versions of linux should work, but have not been validated yet.
