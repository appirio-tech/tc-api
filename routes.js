routes.js 

For web clients (http and https) you can define an optional RESTful mapping to help route requests to actions.
If the client doesn't specify and action in a param, and the base route isn't a named action,
the action will attempt to be discerned from this routes.js file.

- routes remain optional
- actions defiend in params directly `action=theAction` or hitting the named URL for an action `/api/theAction`
    will always override RESTful routing 
- you can mix explicitly defined params with route-defined params. If there is an overlap, the route-defined params win
  - IE: /api/user/123?userId=456 => `connection.userId = 123`
  - this is a change from previous versions
- routes defined with the "all" method will be duplicated to "get", "put", "post", and "delete"
- use ":variable" to defined "variable"
- undefined ":variable" will match
  - IE: "/api/user/" WILL match "/api/user/:userId"
- routes are matched as defined here top-down
- you can optionally define a regex match along with your route variable
  - IE: { path:"/game/:id(^[a-z]{0,10}$)", action: "gamehandler" }
  - be sure to double-escape when needed: { path: "/login/:userID(^\\d{3}$)", action: "login" }

example:

{
  get: [
    { path: "/users", action: "usersList" }, // (GET) /api/users
    { path: "/search/:term/limit/:limit/offset/:offset", action: "search" }, // (GET) /api/search/car/limit/10/offset/1
  ],

  post: [
    { path: "/login/:userID(^\\d{3}$)", action: "login" } // (POST) /api/login/123
  ],

  all: [
    { path: "/user/:userID", action: "user" } // (*) / /api/user/123
  ]
}
